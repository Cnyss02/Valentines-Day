          <p>
            Jab hum log wapas mile 13th December 2024 mein maine sure shot 
            pta tha ki mai tumko pyaar karta hu, koi doubt nhi tha, har time
            sirf tumhare sath but ek din aaya jab mummy ko pta tha ki mai 
            tumko bohut baat karta hu aur pyaar karta hu aur mummy ko achi 
            nhi lagi but thik hai phir bhi maine ladai kiya aur pta nhi kaise
            hua but mummy ne bola ki agar mai friendship ko remove nhi 
            karunga toh ghar mein problems hoga and because I loved you so much
            i couldn't leave you.

            So i forced myself to be with Sneha so my family knows ki ha hum log 
            sirf aur sirf friends hai aur kuch nhi. I know tum trust nhi karoge 
            and i understand but sirf ek chance de do Punam even God knows ki 
            mai kitna pyaar karta hu tumse. Jab tumne bola ki tum kisi aur 
            ko pasand karti ho maine already step back liya kyuki i knew 
            mera hi galti hai jo bhi hua ki I Lost you... But i still prayed and
            I told God ki nhi I will not lose Hope or Give up on Punam.

            I sometimes wish I could meet you in person, but I know it might be
            a long shot. Still, I hope that, even though we are far from each
            other I hope ki, you won't ever forget me. No matter what, I wish
            you a life filled with happiness, peace, and everything you truly
            deserve.
